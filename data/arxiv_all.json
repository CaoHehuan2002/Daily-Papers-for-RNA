    "summary": "We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.",

    "summary": "In music creation, rapid prototyping is essential for exploring and refining ideas, yet existing generative tools often fall short when users require both structural control and stylistic flexibility. Prior approaches in stem-to-stem generation can condition on other musical stems but offer limited control over rhythm, and timbre-transfer methods allow users to specify specific rhythms, but cannot condition on musical context. We introduce DARC, a generative drum accompaniment model that conditions both on musical context from other stems and explicit rhythm prompts such as beatboxing or tapping tracks. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we augment STAGE, a state-of-the-art drum stem generator, with fine-grained rhythm control while maintaining musical context awareness.",

    "summary": "Features of the black hole interior can be extracted from the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions. Working in the geodesic approximation, we find analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. These generate contributions from timelike geodesics that thread the interior and emerge in a future universe. We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators. These correspond to non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. We demonstrate this explicitly in the rotating BTZ black hole by showing that the interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator and motivate a picture for how these contributions arise in higher dimensions. For AdS Schwarzschild, we identify the analytically continued solution that captures the bouncing geodesic. We discuss the possibility of using these continuations to probe the instability of inner horizons from the boundary.",

    "summary": "We introduce Talk2Move, a reinforcement learning (RL) based diffusion framework for text-instructed spatial transformation of objects within scenes. Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.",

    "summary": "A nontrivial peculiarity of general relativity is that when the horizon region of black holes is rendered harmless, the exterior doubles, resulting in a causally disconnected parallel universe. This intricacy plays a central role in 't Hooft's unitarity arguments, emphasising an exact identification between the physical universe and its duplicate on the other side of the horizon. However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We demonstrate that the mismatch in the Boltzmann factor gets fixed if the state that forms the corresponding density matrix adopts a generalised thermofield double structure. That leaves room for some interesting discussion.",

We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is more centrally located. We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated. Taking a more holistic look at Mg II and O VI absorber pairs reveals a much weaker correlation between these two ions.",

Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.",

    "summary": "Companies regularly have to contend with multi-release systems, where several versions of the same software are in operation simultaneously. Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.",

    "summary": "The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions.",

    "summary": "With a view to identifying and understanding the linear receptivity and amplification mechanisms that underpin laminar-to-turbulent transition over blunt bodies in hypersonic flow, we use resolvent analysis to study the flow over a blunt cone with 7° half-angle at Mach number $M_{\\infty} = 6$, zero angle of attack, and nose-radius-based Reynolds number $Re_{R_n} = 90000$. Optimal forcing and responses are obtained for frequencies up to 330 kHz and azimuthal wavenumbers between 0 and 200. Wall-temperature effects are accounted for by considering both isothermal ($T_w =$ 300 K) and adiabatic wall conditions. The resolvent analysis shows that stationary streak modes are the most amplified in the isothermal case, followed by entropy-layer modes between 20 and 140 kHz. In the adiabatic case, the $1^{st}$ Mack mode is the most amplified. The entropy layer, caused by the nose-tip bluntness, has a profound influence on the receptivity structures. For the optimal streak mode, the most intense receptivity structures lie deep in the entropy layer, further away from the boundary-layer edge compared to the equivalent sharp-cone streak mode. This indicates that atmospheric disturbances may excite streak-like instability without fully penetrating the boundary layer. For the entropy-layer modes, the dominant receptivity and fluctuation signatures are located within the entropy layer. An energy-budget analysis reveals that these modes are most susceptible to kinetic disturbances and they sign the most on temperature fluctuations. These modes are found to leverage a temperature mixing mechanism that exploits the baseflow's wall-normal temperature gradient in the entropy layer to grow.",

Here, we provide a systematic study of fabrication and measurement techniques to remove external artifacts in photoelectronic responses. This reveals a previously hidden photothermoelectric response in the transverse photoresistivity of symmetric thin films of simple metals. We identify its origin in thermal gradients producing current deflection and determine the device design and measurement parameters to minimize extrinsic effects that arise in photoinduced electronic responses.",

The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence.   We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, π, φ) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking Gödel's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems.   As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning. This work bridges fundamental physics, mathematical logic, and practical system design, offering both theoretical insights into the nature of learning and computation, and a concrete pathway toward sustainable artificial intelligence.",

Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.",

We focus on the techniques that are absolutely essential for further study, keeping it problem-centered, elementary, visual, and virtually rigorous.",

    "summary": "We present a unified multi-objective model for targeting both advertisements and promotions within the Spotify podcast ecosystem. Our approach addresses key challenges in personalization and cold-start initialization, particularly for new advertising objectives. By leveraging transfer learning from large-scale ad and content interactions within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, a single joint model can be fine-tuned or directly applied to new or low-data targeting tasks, including in-app promotions. This multi-objective design jointly optimizes podcast outcomes such as streams, clicks, and follows for both ads and promotions using a shared representation over user, content, context, and creative features, effectively supporting diverse business goals while improving user experience. Online A/B tests show up to a 22% reduction in effective Cost-Per-Stream (eCPS), particularly for less-streamed podcasts, and an 18-24% increase in podcast stream rates. Offline experiments and ablations highlight the contribution of ancillary objectives and feature groups to cold-start performance. Our experience shows that a unified modeling strategy improves maintainability, cold-start performance, and coverage, while breaking down historically siloed targeting pipelines. We discuss practical trade-offs of such joint models in a real-world advertising system.",

    "summary": "This article proposes generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) for next-generation spatial intelligence in wireless networks. Site-specific beamforming (SSBF) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate the channel acquisition bottleneck in multiantenna systems by exploiting environmental priors. However, classical SSBF based on discriminative deep learning struggles: 1) to properly represent the inherent multimodality of wireless propagation and 2) to effectively capture the structural features of beamformers. In contrast, by leveraging conditional generative models, GenSSBF addresses these issues via learning a conditional distribution over feasible beamformers. By doing so, the synthesis of diverse and high-fidelity beam candidates from coarse channel sensing measurements can be guaranteed. This article presents the fundamentals, system designs, and implementation methods of GenSSBF. Case studies in both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that GenSSBF attains near-optimal beamforming gain with ultra-low channel acquisition overhead. Finally, several open research problems are highlighted.",
