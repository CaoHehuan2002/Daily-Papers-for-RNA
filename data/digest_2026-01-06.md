## 1. [VINO: A Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02358v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02358v1
**作者**: Junyi Chen, Tong He, Zhoujie Fu, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai, Weicai Ye
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:56
**论文摘要**: We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs ar

## 2. [Talk2Move: Reinforcement Learning for Text-Instructed Object-Level Geometric Transformation in Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02356v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02356v1
**作者**: Jing Tan, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yantao Shen, Jiarui Cai, Shuo Yang, Jiajun Wu, Wei Xia, Zhuowen Tu, Stefano Soatto
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:55
**论文摘要**: We introduce Talk2Move, a reinforcement learning (RL) based diffusion framework for text-instructed spatial transformation of objects within scenes. Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and

**论文摘要**: This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\times$ to $7\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both

## 4. [Question Answering for Multi-Release Systems: A Case Study at Ciena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02345v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02345v1
**作者**: Parham Khamsepour, Mark Cole, Ish Ashraf, Sandeep Puri, Mehrdad Sabetzadeh, Shiva Nejati
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:44
**论文摘要**: Companies regularly have to contend with multi-release systems, where several versions of the same software are in operation simultaneously. Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system doc

## 5. [Transverse Photoresistivity from Photothermal Current Deflection in Metal Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02340v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02340v1
**作者**: Piyush Sakrikar, Vincent M. Plisson, Cameron Grant, Dylan Rosenmerkel, Gabriel Natale, Michael Geiwitz, Ying Ran, Krzysztof Kempa, Kenneth S. Burch
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:34
**论文摘要**: Quantum geometry in centrosymmetric systems has motivated the search for photocurrent responses beyond second order. In particular, electric field-induced nonlinear responses may also enable intrinsic polarization-sensitive optical detectors. Despite numerous efforts, clear methods are still needed to remove experimental artifacts, separating intrinsic from extrinsic effects, and disentangling linear responses from their higher-order counterparts. Here, we provide a systematic study of fabricati

## 6. [BEDS: Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02329v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02329v1
**作者**: Laurent Caraffa
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:21
**论文摘要**: We present BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures), a theoretical framework that unifies concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, information geometry, and machine learning. The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermo

## 7. [Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02328v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02328v1
**作者**: Lessard-Hamel Béatrice, Babin Marcel, Thibault Simon
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:20
**论文摘要**: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we

## 8. [A translation of "What is differential geometry: curves and surfaces"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02325v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02325v1
**作者**: Anton Petrunin, Sergio Zamora Barrera
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:16
**论文摘要**: These notes are designed for those who either plan to work in differential geometry, or at least want to have a good reason not to do it. We discuss smooth curves and surfaces -- the main gate to differential geometry. We focus on the techniques that are absolutely essential for further study, keeping it problem-centered, elementary, visual, and virtually rigorous.

## 9. [Cold-Starting Podcast Ads and Promotions with Multi-Task Learning on Spotify](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02306v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02306v1
**作者**: Shivam Verma, Hannes Karlbom, Yu Zhao, Nick Topping, Vivian Chen, Kieran Stanley, Bharath Rengarajan
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 17:48
**论文摘要**: We present a unified multi-objective model for targeting both advertisements and promotions within the Spotify podcast ecosystem. Our approach addresses key challenges in personalization and cold-start initialization, particularly for new advertising objectives. By leveraging transfer learning from large-scale ad and content interactions within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, a single joint model can be fine-tuned or directly applied to new or low-data targeting tasks, including in-app pr

## 10. [Generative Site-Specific Beamforming for Next-Generation Spatial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02301v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02301v1
**作者**: Zhaolin Wang, Zihao Zhou, Cheng-Jie Zhao, Yuanwei Liu
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 17:35
**论文摘要**: This article proposes generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) for next-generation spatial intelligence in wireless networks. Site-specific beamforming (SSBF) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate the channel acquisition bottleneck in multiantenna systems by exploiting environmental priors. However, classical SSBF based on discriminative deep learning struggles: 1) to properly represent the inherent multimodality of wireless propagation and 2) to effectively capture the structura

## 1. [DARC: Drum accompaniment generation with fine-grained rhythm control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02357v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02357v1
**作者**: Trey Brosnan
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:55
**论文摘要**: In music creation, rapid prototyping is essential for exploring and refining ideas, yet existing generative tools often fall short when users require both structural control and stylistic flexibility. Prior approaches in stem-to-stem generation can condition on other musical stems but offer limited control over rhythm, and timbre-transfer methods allow users to specify specific rhythms, but cannot condition on musical context. We introduce DARC, a generative drum accompaniment model that conditi

## 2. [Continuing past the inner horizon using WKB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02354v1)

**作者**: Shadi Ali Ahmad, Ahmed Almheiri, Simon Lin
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:55
**论文摘要**: Features of the black hole interior can be extracted from the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions. Working in the geodesic approximation, we find analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. These generate contributions from timelike geodesics that thread the interior and emerge in a future universe. We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identi

## 3. [On the temperature of the quantum black hole](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02352v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02352v1
**作者**: Abram Akal
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:54
**论文摘要**: A nontrivial peculiarity of general relativity is that when the horizon region of black holes is rendered harmless, the exterior doubles, resulting in a causally disconnected parallel universe. This intricacy plays a central role in 't Hooft's unitarity arguments, emphasising an exact identification between the physical universe and its duplicate on the other side of the horizon. However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrep

## 4. [An information-theoretic bound on cosmic coherence in finite-volume simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02351v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02351v1
**作者**: Biswajit Pandey, Anindita Nandi
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:53
**论文摘要**: We quantify the physical memory of the cosmic density field using mutual information between $N$-body snapshots at different redshifts, removing a random baseline to isolate gravitational correlations. The shared mutual information rises with scale, peaks near $\simeq L/8$ (where $L$ is the simulation box size), and declines thereafter. This behaviour is robust to box size and discretization, and identifies the largest coherently retained modes unaffected by missing long-wavelength power, establ

**论文摘要**: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is key to uncovering the baryon cycle in galaxies. Here we present spatial and kinematic relationships between Mg II and O VI as representatives for low and high ion-bearing gas, in the cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation suite FOGGIE, a set of Milky-way-like galaxy simulations with high CGM resolution. We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is mor

## 6. [Topological Magnons and Giant Orbital Nernst Effect in a Zigzag Kitaev Antiferromagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02342v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02342v1
**作者**: Shreya Debnath, Saurabh Basu
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:37
**论文摘要**: The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transpor

## 7. [Receptivity and instability of the hypersonic flow over moderately blunt cones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02341v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02341v1
**作者**: N. d'Eprémesnil, C. Caillaud, G. Lehnasch, M. Olazabal, P. Jordan
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:34
**论文摘要**: With a view to identifying and understanding the linear receptivity and amplification mechanisms that underpin laminar-to-turbulent transition over blunt bodies in hypersonic flow, we use resolvent analysis to study the flow over a blunt cone with 7° half-angle at Mach number $M_{\infty} = 6$, zero angle of attack, and nose-radius-based Reynolds number $Re_{R_n} = 90000$. Optimal forcing and responses are obtained for frequencies up to 330 kHz and azimuthal wavenumbers between 0 and 200. Wall-te

## 8. [The Sequential Monte Carlo goes NUTS: Boosting Gravitational-Wave Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02336v1)
**arXiv ID**: 2601.02336v1
**作者**: Gabriele Demasi, Giulia Capurri, Massimo Lenti, Angelo Ricciardone, Barbara Patricelli, Adriano Frattale Mascioli, Lorenzo Piccari, Saulo Albuquerque, Gianluca M. Guidi, Francesco Pannarale, Giulia St
**更新时间**: 2026-01-05 18:31
**论文摘要**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently been applied to gravitational-wave inference as a powerful alternative to standard sampling techniques, such as Nested Sampling. At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC
